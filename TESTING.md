Testing was ongoing throughout the entire build. We utilised Chrome developer tools whilst building to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues as we went along.

Each page and the functionalities of the game have been inspected using google chrome developer tools & Firefox inspector tool to ensure that each page is fully responsive on a variety of different screen sizes and devices. I have also physically tested the responsiveness of the site on a number of different devices.

## AUTOMATED TESTING

### W3C Validator

[W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the HTML of the website. It was also used to validate the CSS.

No warnings or errors were found

- - -

### JavaScript Validator

[jshint](https://jshint.com/) was used to validate the JavaScript.

No errors were found, and all warnings come from the libraries used to create the custom alerts (not errors, just the algorithm does not detect them as foreign callings.)

### Lighthouse

I used Lighthouse within the Chrome Developer Tools to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the website.


### Desktop Results

* Game Page
![Game Page lighthouse testing mobile](./assets/testing/lighthouse-desktop.png)

* Images' Credits Page
![Login Page Lighthouse testing desktop](./assets/testing/credits-lighthouse-desktop.png)

Accesibility was lower than expected due to the contrast ratio generated by the blue on the title.

SEO does not apply for this page.

### Mobile Results

* Game Page
![Game Page lighthouse testing mobile](./assets/testing/lighthouse-mobile.png)

The performance was affected, mainly due to the sizes of the images. Nevertheless, the loading time and the actual data load is not significant, it just could be further optimmized in cases where no caching has taken place.

* Credits Page

Accesibility was lower than expected due to the contrast ratio generated by the blue on the title.

## MANUAL TESTING

### Testing User Stories

`Players`

| Goals | How are they achieved? | Image |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| As a first time user, I want to be able to easily understand the game rules. | I used a minimalistic approach in wich the film poster is displayed with all 4 possibilities at the right side. Therefore, the user only has the chance of interacting with the options and the game categories.  | ![Game Controls](./assets/testing/game-controls.png) |
| As a user, I want to be able to track my performance. | At the right side, the score keeps track of how many images have been displayed per categorie, and how many have been correctly guess. No errors are track, so the user has better a success ratio, rather than a negative feedback. | ![Game Score](./assets/testing/game-score.png) |
