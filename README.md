# Welcome to my film trivia game,

This is the second project for the full stack development course of Code Institute. It is a web-page that contains a film trivia game in which the user will need to match the picture of the director and/or the actor of the movie of the film on the left side of the page.

For now, 10 films are included, but the database will be expanded overtime, as it has been crated in a way that could contain up to a thousand movies.

## User Experience (UX)

### Design Idea

The idea behind the game is to match the Film Poster with the photo of the director or the actor/actress. No text was used for the guessing, as film is a completely visual experience. Therefore, only the names are revealed as soon as a selection is made.

### How to Play

By default, the game is set to guess the director of the film. Each movie will be represented by its poster, and 4 alternatives for the director will be displayed.

There are two buttons to choose the kind of game the user would like to play: Director or Actor/Actress.

The Director option (default) has already been shown. The actor options is the one above, but this one has a particularity: it is not necessarily the main character of the movie. So, for example, in Die Haard, the user must guess for Bonnie Bedelia and not for Bruce Willis.

### Visual Concept

The color palette was influenced by the Wes Anderson' movies, and it was found at [Schemecolor](https://www.schemecolor.com/retro-hollywood.php)

### Typography

Google Fonts was used for the fontand its variations:

* [Quicksand](https://fonts.google.com/share?selection.family=Quicksand:wght@300;500).

### Imagery

All images werre taken from the Internet and the credits can be found here (https://parbelaez.github.io/the-film-trivia/credits.html).


### Accessibility

The website is as accessible and friendly as possible, for users and possible future developers. I have achieved this by:

* Simplicity, so the user knows graphically and intuitively what should be done.
* Using semantic HTML.
* Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
* Providing information for screen readers where there are icons used and no text.
* Ensuring menus are accessible by marking the current page as current for screen readers.
